Please use postman for sending JSON in request and receiving JSON in Response.

This backend is designed in accordance with any third party frontend framework (React or Angular).

All JSON request need to be sent in accordance with models designed (similar key value pair).

I have used serializers just to serialize data to django readable formats.

For ease of understanding the working of designed backend I will be submitting the frontend developed in Angular.
